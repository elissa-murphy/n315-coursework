        Buy 2 Give 1, a food gleaning program administered through the Original
        Farmers' Market, encourages individuals to buy additional products for
        those who are in need of fresh, healthy products. All of the donations
        are made at the City Market tent during the Original Farmers' Market
        hours, and are given to one of three downtown homeless missions to
        prepare healthy meals for those in need. Each year, thousands of pounds
        of produce are given to those who need it most through the program. In
        fact, about 3,000 lbs of fresh Indiana-grown produce was gleaned
        throughout the 2018 Original Farmers' Market season.
