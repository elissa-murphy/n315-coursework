    <h2>OUR VISION & MISSION</h2>
    <img src="images/divider.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      We envision a vibrant, thriving, connected and inclusive Mass Ave
      Cultural Arts District supported by an engaged community of
      neighborhoods, businesses, and cultural venues. That vision
      celebrates the authenticity of our history, heritage, and
      environment. It supports those who live, work, play, perform,
      create, and invest in our unique and diverse place within downtown
      Indianapolis.
    </p>
    <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
    <img src="images/divider.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      Founded in late 2021, the group formed as it observed the fragility
      of Mass Ave during the pandemic and the potential to come away from
      it stronger, smarter, and more inclusive than before. <br />
      <br />
      The group witnessed how the Mass Ave corridor reinvented to adapt
      and survive; and how the larger Indianapolis community valued Mass
      Ave as a safe and welcoming place. The Mass Ave Cultural Arts
      District was born to leverage the power of this collective
      identification with Mass Ave to reorganize the cultural district
      concept as a more expansive, inclusive and sustainable version of
      itself.
